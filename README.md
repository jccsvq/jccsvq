- 👋 Hi, I’m @jccsvq, a retired (astro)physicist. I was a professor at the University of Seville (Spain) for 43 years, where I estimate I had around 4,000 students. I taught general physics, theoretical mechanics, optics, solid-state physics, and, primarily, astronomy and astrophysics (not to mention karate...).
- 👀 I’m interested in ancient calculating instruments, mainly abacuses 🧮
- 🌱 I'm currently learning a little about everything, taking advantage of the fact that I am retired ...
